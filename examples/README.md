# TSPP Examples

This directory contains example programs demonstrating various features of the TSPP language.

## Running Examples

To run any example:

1. Make sure TSPP is built (run `./build.sh` from the root directory)
2. Use the test script to compile and run:
   ```bash
   ./test.sh examples/hello_world.tspp
   ```

## Available Examples

### Basic Examples

- **`hello_world.tspp`** - The classic "Hello, World!" program
- **`variables.tspp`** - Variable declarations, types, and constants
- **`functions.tspp`** - Function definitions, parameters, and return values

### Language Features

More examples will be added as the language develops to demonstrate:

- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Classes and interfaces
- Memory management
- SIMD operations
- Advanced type system features

## Notes

- All examples assume a basic understanding of TypeScript-like syntax
- Examples are designed to be self-contained and runnable
