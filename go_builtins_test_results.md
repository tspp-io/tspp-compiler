# TSPP++ Go Built-ins Test Results

## Test Suite Overview

This document contains the comprehensive test results for the Go built-in functions implemented in the TSPP++ standard library. The implementation includes all core Go built-ins with proper semantics and memory management.

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Comprehensive Unit Tests
**File:** `tests/go_builtins_test.cpp`
**Status:** All 32 tests passed (100% success rate)

**Tested Functions:**
- **Memory Allocation:** `tspp_make_slice()`, `tspp_make_map()`, `tspp_make_channel()`, `tspp_new()`
- **Collection Operations:** `tspp_len()`, `tspp_cap()`
- **Slice Operations:** `tspp_append()`, `tspp_copy()`
- **Map Operations:** `tspp_delete()`
- **Channel Operations:** `tspp_close()`
- **Error Handling:** `tspp_panic()`, `tspp_recover()`

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Zero-initialization behavior
- ✅ Memory allocation and growth
- ✅ Capacity management and doubling strategy
- ✅ Bounds checking and null pointer handling
- ✅ Overlapping memory copy operations
- ✅ Edge cases and error conditions

### ✅ Integration Demo
**File:** `tests/go_builtins_integration_demo.cpp`
**Status:** All operations completed successfully

**Demonstrated Features:**
- Dynamic slice growth from capacity 1 → 1024 (10 growth events)
- Memory efficiency: 97.7% utilization for 1000-element slice
- Zero-value allocation working correctly
- String length operations
- Channel state management
- Copy operations with data integrity

### ✅ Error Handling Tests  
**File:** `tests/go_panic_test.cpp`
**Status:** Panic/recover mechanism validated

**Verified Capabilities:**
- `setjmp`/`longjmp` non-local control flow
- Panic message storage and retrieval
- Recovery point management
- Go-compatible error semantics

## Performance Characteristics

### Slice Growth Strategy
The implementation follows Go's growth strategy:
- Initial capacity: 1
- Growth pattern: doubles when full (1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 → 64 → 128 → 256 → 512 → 1024)
- Memory efficiency: ~97.7% for large slices
- Growth events: 10 reallocations for 1000 elements

### Memory Management  
- Zero-initialization of all allocated memory
- Proper cleanup and memory leak prevention
- Compatible with Boehm GC integration
- Safe overlapping memory operations using `memmove`
