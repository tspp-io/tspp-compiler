# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and aim to address security vulnerabilities promptly. The following versions of TSPP are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in TSPP, please report it responsibly by following these guidelines:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL] with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow coordinated disclosure principles
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue before any public disclosure
- We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (with your permission)
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it

## Security Considerations

### Compiler Security

TSPP is a compiler that generates LLVM IR and native code. Please be aware of the following security considerations:

1. **Input Validation**: The compiler performs parsing and validation of source code, but malformed input could potentially cause issues
2. **Code Generation**: Generated code inherits the security properties of the target platform
3. **Memory Management**: TSPP uses Boehm GC and AddressSanitizer in debug builds to help detect memory-related issues

### Runtime Security

1. **Memory Safety**: TSPP aims to provide memory safety through garbage collection and bounds checking
2. **Type Safety**: The type system helps prevent common programming errors
3. **SIMD Operations**: Be aware that SIMD operations may have platform-specific security implications

## Best Practices for Users

When using TSPP in production:

1. Use the latest supported version
2. Enable compiler security features when available
3. Follow secure coding practices in your TSPP code
4. Regularly update dependencies
5. Use static analysis tools where appropriate

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.1.2)
- Documented in the CHANGELOG with security advisory references
- Announced through our standard communication channels

## Scope

This security policy covers:
- The TSPP compiler itself
- Standard library components
- Build tools and scripts included in this repository

This policy does NOT cover:
- Third-party dependencies (report to their respective maintainers)
- User-generated code compiled by TSPP
- Deployment environments and configurations
