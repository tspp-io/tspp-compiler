## Development Setup

### Project Structure

│   ├── parser/            # Parsing logic
│   ├── types/             # Type system

└── tools/                 # Development tools
```

### Building Components

```bash
# Full build
./build.sh

# Debug build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
make -j$(nproc)

# Run specific tests
./test.sh examples/hello.tspp
```

## Coding Guidelines

### C++ Style

We use **clang-format** for code formatting. The configuration is in `.clang-format`.

```bash
# Format your code before committing
clang-format -i src/**/*.cpp src/**/*.h
```

### Key Principles

1. **Performance**: TSPP++ is designed for performance - consider the impact of your changes
2. **Safety**: Maintain memory safety and type safety
3. **Clarity**: Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
4. **Testing**: Include tests for new functionality
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation for user-facing changes

### Code Style Rules

- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and types
- Use **UPPER_CASE** for constants and macros
- Prefer `std::unique_ptr` over raw pointers
- Use `const` wherever possible
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for complex algorithms

### Example Code Style

```cpp
// Good
class ASTNode {
public:
    virtual ~ASTNode() = default;
    virtual void accept(Visitor& visitor) const = 0;
    
private:
    std::string name_;
    std::unique_ptr<Type> type_;
};

// Avoid
class astnode {  // Wrong naming
public:
    Type* type;  // Raw pointer, not const
    void DoSomething();  // Unclear function name
};
```

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions or modifications
- `build`: Build system changes
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### Examples

```bash
feat(parser): add support for union types
fix(lexer): handle nested comments correctly
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(codegen): add tests for SIMD operations
```
